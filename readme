## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow the steps below to get your development environment set up:

### 1. **Create an Expo Project**

First, initialize your Expo app with the navigation template using TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-expo-app ../ --template Navigation (TypeScript)
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

Install all necessary packages for React Query, Zustand, Expo Router, and TW-RNC:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query expo-router zustand twrnc react-native-maps @expo/vector-icons
```

### 3. **Setup JSON Server**

For local API development, install **JSON Server**:

```bash
npm install json-server
```

### 4. **Start the Local API Server**

Run the following command to start your local API server, which watches for changes in the `db.json` file:

```bash
json-server --watch ./server/db.json --port 3000
```

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

### Starting the App

Once all dependencies are installed and the local API server is running, you can start your Expo app with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the Expo developer tools in your browser, where you can run the app on your physical device or emulator.

```

Make sure to run the JSON server (`json-server --watch ./server/db.json --port 3000`) before testing the API.
