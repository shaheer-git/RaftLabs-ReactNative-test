# Project Name: **Expo App with React Query, Zustand, and TW-RNC Styling**

Welcome to this powerful Expo app built with **React Query**, **Zustand**, **Expo Router**, and **TWRNC** for styling. This app utilizes modern tools to provide a smooth, efficient, and scalable development experience with a fully functional local API server powered by **JSON Server**.

## 🚀 Features

- **React Query**: Efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- **Zustand**: A lightweight state management solution for React.
- **Expo Router**: Simple routing and navigation in Expo apps.
- **TW-RNC (Tailwind React Native Classnames)**: Utility-first styling for React Native.
- **JSON Server**: A mock API server for local development.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Expo**: A framework for building React Native apps with ease.
- **React Query**: Data fetching and synchronization library.
- **Zustand**: Simple state management for React apps.
- **Expo Router**: A router for easy navigation in Expo apps.
- **TWRNC**: Tailwind CSS with React Native styling (tailwind for mobile).
- **JSON Server**: A full fake REST API with JSON data.

## 🛠️ Installation

Follow the steps below to get your development environment set up:

### 1. **Create an Expo Project**

First, initialize your Expo app with the navigation template using TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-expo-app ../ --template Navigation (TypeScript)
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

Install all necessary packages for React Query, Zustand, Expo Router, and TW-RNC:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query expo-router zustand twrnc react-native-maps @expo/vector-icons
```

### 3. **Setup JSON Server**

For local API development, install **JSON Server**:

```bash
npm install json-server
```

### 4. **Start the Local API Server**

Run the following command to start your local API server, which watches for changes in the `db.json` file:

```bash
json-server --watch ./server/db.json --port 3000
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### Starting the App

Once all dependencies are installed and the local API server is running, you can start your Expo app with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the Expo developer tools in your browser, where you can run the app on your physical device or emulator.

```

Make sure to run the JSON server (`json-server --watch ./server/db.json --port 3000`) before testing the API.

## 📦 Dependencies

- **@tanstack/react-query**: Data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- **expo-router**: Simplifies routing for Expo apps.
- **zustand**: A minimal state management library.
- **twrnc**: Tailwind CSS classes for React Native.
- **react-native-maps**: Map integration for React Native.
- **@expo/vector-icons**: A set of vector icons from Expo.

## 📝 Notes

- Make sure your local API server is running (`json-server --watch ./server/db.json --port 3000`) before testing the data fetching features.
- Ensure you have the latest versions of **Node.js** and **npm** installed for compatibility.
